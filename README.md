# bloginfo
A simple web app where users can add blog posts and urls to a shared page. Other users can "like" blogs and blogs are displayed in order of number of likes (once during useEffect()). Users delete blogs that they have created. 
# login system
This app was primarily created to demonstrate a login system using password hashing and user token authorization. Password hashes are stored in a database with user details and user input is validated against this hash.
