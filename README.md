# bloginfo
A simple web app where users can add blog posts and urls to a shared page. Other users can "like" blogs and blogs are displayed in order of number of likes (sorted once upon loading page -  useEffect()). Users can only delete blogs that they have created. 
# login system
This app was primarily created to demonstrate a login system using password hashing and user token authorization. Password hashes (bcrypt) are stored in a database with user details and login attempts are validated against these details. 
# notifications
A notification system is semi-complete, allowing for easy user identification of any issues.
